Hi my name is Alexander Weiss - I am a passionate Frontend Web Developer!
This repository contains the codebase for my first basic React-based portfolio website (work in progress). 

The website was built with the help of a tutorial by Clinty Briley (fireclint).
The code is NOT copy-pasted. I followed along to the tutorial to make sure to understand every step of the building process.
While coding I experimented and made some minor adjustments according to my personal taste.

Feel free to browse the code, contribute, or use it as a reference for your projects. Thank you for visiting!
